# Test-Sorting
This exercise is about getting familiar with unit testing and JUnit 4.12 in particular.

First, you need to design and code a simple sorting method in the Sorting class. Here are some details:

the method sorts an integer array in ascending order,
an integer array is passed as a parameter to the method,
when given array is null, the method must throw an IllegalArgumentException.
Next, you need to complete the test methods in SortingTest class. Use assertions to check your sorting methods. Be sure to use @Test annotation parameters to catch expected exceptions.

In order to pass the exercise, your tests must correctly detect flaws of some other sorting method implementations. There are special tests in SortingTestsTest class that applies your tests to your and some of such bad implementations. Your sorting method must pass your tests, and others must fail in some cases.

Your sorting method must pass your tests while other implementations must fail your tests in some cases.
